    <h1>California Privacy Rights</h1>
<p>This California Privacy Rights page describes how MANIFEST XM collects, uses and shares the personal information of California residents in cases in which we operate as a "business" under the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 ("CCPA"). This page also provides information for California residents, as required under California privacy laws, including the CCPA, which requires that we provide California residents certain specific information about how we handle their personal information, whether collected online or offline.
Under the CCPA, “personal information” is any information that identifies, relates to, describes, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular California resident or household. Because the CCPA requires that we disclose specific information about how we handle certain personal information collected about all California consumers, the scope of this section may be different than the scope of our privacy policy.
This page does not apply to:
•	information exempted from the scope of the CCPA;
•	information collected in a business-to-business context, namely, where the information reflects our communications or transactions with you in the context of performing due diligence on, providing services to, or receiving services from, a company, partnership, sole proprietorship, non-profit or government agency where you are an employee, controlling owner, director, officer or contractor of that organization;
•	activities governed by a different privacy notice, such as notices we give to California personnel or job candidates; or
•	personal information that we collect, use, and share on behalf of our customers as a "service provider" under the CCPA.
Your California Privacy Rights under California’s Shine-the-Light Law
Under California’s “Shine the Light” law (Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83), California residents who provide us certain personal information are entitled to know that We do not sell your personal information to other businesses for their own marketing purposes, or exchange it for any other form of consideration to our business. We do not share personal information of individual, non-business customers (as defined under Cal. Civ. Code § 1798.83) with unaffiliated third parties for their own independent marketing purposes without consent.
