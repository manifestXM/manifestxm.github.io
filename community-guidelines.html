    <h1>MANIFEST XM Community Guidelines</h1>
<p>
Here are some common-sense rules that'll help you steer clear of trouble. Please take these rules seriously and take them to heart. Don't try to look for loopholes or try to lawyer your way around the guidelines—just understand them and try to respect the spirit in which they were created.
1.	Nudity of sexual content
MANIFEST XM is not for pornography or sexually explicit content. If this describes your content, even if it's an audio/video/picture of yourself, don't post it on MANIFEST XM. Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child exploitation.
2.	Harmful or dangerous content
Don't post content that encourages others to do things that might cause them to get badly hurt, especially kids. Content showing or describing such harmful or dangerous acts may get age-restricted or removed depending on their severity.
3.	Hateful content
Our product is a platform for free expression. But we don't support content that promotes or condones violence against individuals or groups based on race or ethnic origin, religion, disability, gender, age, nationality, veteran status, or sexual orientation/gender identity, or whose primary purpose is inciting hatred on the basis of these core characteristics. This can be a delicate balancing act, but if the primary purpose is to attack a protected group, the content crosses the line.
4.	Violent or graphic content
It's not okay to post violent or gory content that's primarily intended to be shocking, sensational, or gratuitous. If posting graphic content in a news or documentary context, please be mindful to provide enough information to help people understand what's going on in the audio or video. Don't encourage others to commit specific acts of violence.
5.	Harassment and cyberbullying
It’s not ok to post abusive audios, videos, and comments on MANIFEST XM. If harassment crosses the line into a malicious attack it can be reported and may be removed. In other cases, users may be mildly annoying or petty and should be ignored.
6.	Spam, misleading metadata, and scams
Everyone hates spam. Don't create misleading descriptions, tags, titles, or thumbnails in order to increase listens. It's not okay to post large amounts of untargeted, unwanted or repetitive content, including comments and private messages.
7.	Threats
Things like predatory behavior, stalking, threats, harassment, intimidation, invading privacy, revealing other people's personal information, and inciting others to commit violent acts or to violate the Terms of Use are taken very seriously. Anyone caught doing these things may be permanently banned from MANIFEST XM.
8.	Copyright
Respect copyright. Only upload content that you made or that you're authorized to use. This means don't upload audios you didn't make, or use content in your audios that someone else owns the copyright to, such as music tracks, snippets of copyrighted programs, or audios made by other users, without necessary authorizations.
9.	Privacy
If someone has posted your personal information or uploaded audio of you without your consent, you can request the removal of content based on our Privacy Guidelines.
10.	Impersonation
Accounts that are established to impersonate another channel or individual may be removed.
11.	Child Safety
Learn about how we protect minors in the MANIFEST XM ecosystem. Also, be advised that we work closely with law enforcement and we report child endangerment.
Additional policies

If you post content that encourages other users to violate our Terms of Service, the content may be removed, your account may be penalized, and in some cases, your account may be terminated.
2.	Vulgar language

How to make your good quality podcast show?
Focus on following things to create a professional quality podcast and gain maximum listeners
1.	Understand your audience
If you can clearly articulate the type of people and their interests who would listen to your podcast, you are likely to make good content for them.
2.	Know your content

3.	Equipment
Audio quality matters. Your content matters and so if your content audio clarity and quality. You may record your podcast using MANIFEST XM recording tool to minimize noise. It’s free. You can also invest in adequate mics and pop filters to set up an in -house studio. It doesn’t cost much but boosts overall audio quality.
4.	Podcast episode length
We strongly recommend to keep an episode duration more than 5 min and not more than 20 min. Time is precious so don’t drag a conversation without adding more value to it. Without smaller episode duration people forget you and your podcast name.
5.	Thumbnail and Description
This is the last thing that you make but the first thing that your audience will see. A good thumbnail and description can increase you up to 3x more listeners.
Pro tip - Create a trailer for your podcast as well.
6.	Intros and Outros
Now that your podcast is out in the market people consume it without looking at their mobile screen. A good podcast intro and outro will make an audio brand in your listeners mind. This will help you grab their attention easily next time. Do use MANIFEST XM name and your show name in your intro to remind people where they can find you next time. A good outro can hook people for your next episode. Also do ask people to follow you for more updates. This will boost your brand presence.
7.	Keep posting
People consume their favourite podcast daily, weekly. It’s similar to their behaviour of watching their favourite TV show. They expect new episodes at fixed duration. Depending upon your podcast topic and audience requirements we encourage you to post daily or at least weekly episodes. This will help you gain good followers.
